# code-challenges

This codes are my code answers to the python coding exam by Shortcut Catalyst Programming course. 

### The exam consited of two parts: 
1. theory exam submitted via Google sheet 
2. 6 coding assignments requiring semi-advanced knowlege in python programming and most importantly computer algorithms!


### Thins to know:
Because I am still a beginner, my codes may provide inaccurate results or functionality. 
1. If you are curious about how I coded, feel free to have a look. However if you know a better way to do, feel free to send me your suggestions. Or 
2. if you are assessing my coding skills, my logics might not be the best but this is a part of my journey to train my computer-logical thinking. :)
